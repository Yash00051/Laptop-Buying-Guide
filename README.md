📘 Laptop Buying Guide
🖥️ Introduction
Choosing the right laptop can be confusing, especially for students who are buying their first device. There are hundreds of models available, each with different specifications, prices, and features.
This project is a Laptop Buying Guide that helps users find the most suitable laptop according to their given inputs. Instead of searching endlessly on the internet, users can simply provide their requirements (like budget, usage type, RAM size, etc.), and the program will suggest laptops that match those needs.
The project is designed with simplicity in mind, so that even a B.Tech 1st year student can understand the code, run it, and learn from it. It is a practical example of how programming can solve real-life problems.

🎯 Objectives
- To help students and beginners choose laptops based on their requirements.
- To demonstrate how user inputs can be processed in Python to give meaningful outputs.
- To provide a beginner-friendly project that can be extended with more features in the future.

✨ Features
- Accepts user inputs such as:
- Budget (price range)
- Purpose (gaming, programming, office work, multimedia, etc.)
- RAM size
- Storage type (HDD/SSD)
- Processor preference (Intel/AMD)
- Matches inputs with a dataset of laptops.
- Displays recommended laptops with specifications.
- Easy to extend: you can add more laptops or features to the dataset.
