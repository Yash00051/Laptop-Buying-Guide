- It asks the user for inputs such as budget, display type, resolution, brightness, screen size, RAM, and storage preference.
- Based on the entered budget, the program checks which laptops fall within that price range using multiple conditional statements.
- A loop iterates through the dataset and prints laptops that match the user’s budget and other requirements.
- The final output displays the laptop(s) with their specifications, helping the user choose according to their needs.
